## üìÑ Documentation
Detailed documentation for this project can be found in the following Google Drive folder: [Project Documentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r0-S5Q8p94ltqEWH3tZytd2wM67fj6aC?usp=drive_link).

## üß© **Architecture**
The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.

**Key Components:**
+ **Model**: Manages data and business logic, interacting with Firestore for data persistence.
+ **View**: UI components, including fragments and activities that display data to the user.
+ **ViewModel**: Acts as a mediator between the View and Model, handling UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

## ‚ú® **Features** 
+ **AR-Based Navigation**: Provides users with augmented reality guidance within the campus.
+ **Dynamic Location Management**: Allows administrators to add, update, and delete location data in real-time.
+ **Interactive UI**: Users can interact with the AR environment to get more information about specific locations.
+ **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various Android devices and screen sizes.
